# Neovim configs

Last used with Neovim v0.10.2 on WSL Ubuntu.

## Installation

These instructions assume that [dotfiles](https://github.com/shyun3/dotfiles)
have been setup on Windows and Ubuntu.

1. Clone this repo to the [proper directory][nvim-config-dir]:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shyun3/nvimrc ~/.config/nvim
    ```

1. Start Neovim. Plugins should start automatically installing.

1. Run `:checkhealth` and resolve any issues.

1. Restart Neovim. Installation should now be complete.

## Example configuration files

See the corresponding [README](example-configs/readme.md).

## Tips

### clangd

* The [example clangd config](example-configs/clangd-config) contains hints for
  cross-compiling and resolving system header issues. The `clangd` [system
  headers](https://clangd.llvm.org/guides/system-headers) documentation is also
  helpful.
* When specifying paths with embedded spaces in `compile_flags.txt`, do not
  introduce quotes or backslashes to escape as this will be handled by
  `clangd`. For example:
  ```
  -Ipath with spaces
  ```

### Python

* Formatter options may be specified through a project top-level
  `pyproject.toml`, for example:
    ```
    [tool.black]
    unstable = true

    [tool.isort]
    profile = "black"
    ```
  Using the unstable option for black may be useful to have it break long
  strings, see the [future style docs][black-future]. `isort` can also be
  configured for `black` compatibility by specifying the profile (see
  [docs][isort-black]).
* [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) can read type stubs placed in
  the `typings` directory. This can be customized using the `stubPath` option
  in the `pyrightconfig.json`. See also [Generating Type Stubs][type-stubs].

### UltiSnips

* Add snippets under the `UltiSnips/specific` directory for snippets that are
  meant to be machine-specific and not saved in the repo, see the UltiSnips
  plugin setup.
